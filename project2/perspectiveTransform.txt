The perspective transform from lecture is in terms of F, D, H, W, while the book's perspective
transform is in terms of near, far, top , bottom, left, right. 

It basically comes out to be the same thing. From the lecture's matrix, the first column has 
2D/W and the book's has near/right. D and near are actually same concept of variables, the 
difference here is the right and W. W is the width of the view plane while right is only the
right side of the camera. So W would be twice as long as right, that's why matrix from class 
needed to have 2D. The explanation for other parts of the matrix is also similar this to 
explanation. 

The other difference was that the third column of the class's matrix is positive while the book's
is negative. That is because the book's matrix has the plane z to be between -1 and 1. The class 
matrix is between 0 and 1.
